# binary-classification-project

In this project, I evaluated 3 binary classifier models in order to replicate results from https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/ctp/ct.papers/caruana.icml06.pdf. Then, I used the final accuracies to build a stacked-ensemble classifier and evaluated that model on a separate dataset. Submitted for credit for COGS 118A @ UCSD.
